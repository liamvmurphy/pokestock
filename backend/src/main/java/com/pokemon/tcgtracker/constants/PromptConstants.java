        - **Product Type**: ETB, Booster Box, Tin, Bundle, etc.
        - **Price**: Listing price in AUD
        - **Quantity**: Available quantity
        - **Location**: Melbourne, VIC areas

        - **eBay Listing 1-5 Price**: Actual sold prices from eBay (provides real market validation)

        ## Analysis Requirements

        ### 1. Data Cleaning & Standardization
        **Standardize Product Names:**
        - Clean inconsistent naming (e.g., "etb" ‚Üí "Elite Trainer Box")
        - Identify actual Pokemon sets from product names
        - Detect Japanese vs English products (default English unless specified)
        - Flag obvious data errors (e.g., $1 ETBs, "Analyzing with AI..." entries)

        **Set Identification Rules:**
        - "prismatic", "prismatic evolutions" ‚Üí SV8.5 Prismatic Evolutions
        - "black bolt", "white flare" ‚Üí SV7 Stellar Crown
        - "151", "pokemon 151" ‚Üí SV3.5 151
        - "celebrations" ‚Üí SWSH8.5 Celebrations
        - "evolving skies" ‚Üí SWSH7 Evolving Skies
        - "paldean fates" ‚Üí SV4.5 Paldean Fates
        - Japanese indicators: "japanese", "japan", "jp" in name/notes

        ### 2. Market Value Analysis
        **PRIORITY ORDER for Market Value Determination:**
        
        1. **eBay Median Price (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**: When available, use eBay median as primary market reference
        2. **eBay Listing Analysis**: Analyze the 5 recent eBay sales for price trends and validation
        3. **Fallback Guidelines**: Use these only when eBay data is unavailable:
           - Elite Trainer Box: $120-180 (English), $100-150 (Japanese)
           - Booster Box: $160-280 (English), $130-250 (Japanese)
           - Mini Tins: $20-35
           - Premium/Special sets: 20-50% above standard pricing
           - Vintage/rare sets: Significantly higher premiums
        
        **eBay Analysis Instructions:**
        - Compare Facebook price vs eBay median to determine real deal quality
        - Look for price consistency across the 5 eBay listings
